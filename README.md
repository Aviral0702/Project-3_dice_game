# React Dice Game

This is a simple dice game built with React and styled-components.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main components:

- `StartGame`: This component is responsible for the initial game setup. It displays a "Play Now" button to start the game.

- `GamePlay`: This component handles the game logic and displays the game interface.

The `App` component manages the state of the game and switches between the `StartGame` and `GamePlay` components based on whether the game has started.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
npm install
npm start
```
The application will start running at http://localhost:3000.
